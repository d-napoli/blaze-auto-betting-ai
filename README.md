# Blaze AI Automation Project
### What is Blaze?
Blaze is an online platform for betting. There are several betting modalities.<br>

#### ‚ö†Ô∏èüõë   This project was made entirely for fun. There's no intention of getting rich or earning money with this algorithm.   üõë‚ö†Ô∏è

The algorithm bets in the **crash modality**. 
Crash is a game modalitie where you insert money and a bar keeps raising upwards. You have a button for stop the transaction. If you're able to take the money out, before the bar stops growing, **its yours**. If you don't take the money out and the bar crashes, **you've lot what you bet**.<br><br>

#### How the algorithm works
The algorithm has two **prediction models**

- KNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)
- Deep Learning

When the code starts running, the model is trained based on historical data. It has over 1 million matches historical data.<br>
Based on the predictions, the algorithm takes the decision rather it's worth it betting money in the next round, or it isn't.
